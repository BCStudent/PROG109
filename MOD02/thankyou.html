  <h1>Thank you for visiting my website!</h1>
<p>This website is being created and updated with assignments from PROG109: Intro to Web Development.</p>
<p>As a consumer of webpages, I never gave their creation or function much thought. As long as the page loaded quickly and 
 I obtained what I needed quickly, I was a happy surfer! </p>
<p>Now that I am learning the "nuts and bolts" of web development, I have a new found respect for all those faceless web 
 developers around the world!</p>
