	<h1>This is Me!</h1>
  <h2>Created by Paul Walters</h2>
  <hr>
<p>As I sat across from my Director and the HR representative, on that fateful day in April 2017,
  little did I realize that my 28 years of professional experience would no longer guarantee me a job in this economy.  
  I was now considered a “mature” worker with outdated skills and a disability (when did diabetes become a disability?!).</p>
<p>After submitting 100’s of applications and only receiving a handful of calls from recruiters, I decided to return to college 
  to secure a Database Report Developer certification. I’m hoping that after a couple of quarters under my belt and some newly 
  acquired skills, I will once again be considered employable!</p>
<p>My goal is to secure a position that either allows me to telecommute 100% of the time or offers flexible scheduling so I can care 
  for my niece when needed. </p>
<p>Having experienced and survived two layoffs, I have learned that at the end of the day, you’re not going to look around and think
  about all the hours you worked, the projects your completed or the promotions you achieved. Your going to look around for the people 
  who mean the most to you! </p>
