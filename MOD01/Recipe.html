<strong>Instructions</strong>
<ol>
	<li>Roughly dice the onion & garlic. Don't worry too much about chopping it fine, the soup will be blended.</li> 
		
	<li>Heat some oil in a heavy bottom pot, then toss in the onion and garlic and sautee them for 3-4 minutes on medium-high 
		until they turn soft and translucent.</li>
	<li>Cut up 4 corn tortillas into roughly 1 inch pieces; also cut up one jalapeno/serrano pepper (de-seed it first if you
		want to cut down on the heat.</li>
	<li>Add the tortilla pieces & Jalapeno/serrano to the pot and sautee them for a couple minutes with the onion & garlic.</li>
	<li>Next, pour in a whole can of Ro-tel (diced tomatoes with green chillies) and 5 cups of chicken broth.</li>
	<li>Add some cumin, cayeene pepper and oregano to the pot and bring everything up to a boil. Then tuirn off the heat, 
		add finely chopped cilantro and allow the soup to cool enough to put in the blender.</li>
	<li>Once the soup has cooled off a little, spoon the soup into a blender/food processor in batches and puree the 
		soup until it's smooth.</li>
	<li>Return the soup to the pot, turn the heat on to medium-high and let it thicken.</li>
	<li>Add the corn & chicken to the soup and very gently stir them in. Lower the heat to a gentle simmer and let 
		the corn cook through for a coopule minutes. Taste and season the soup with salt (keeping in mind the broth was probably salted).</li>
	<li>Lastly, pour in the cream and add the cheese to the soup, stir it gently to mix everything together.</li>
	<li>For a topping, you can make your own tortilla strips by cutting 3-4 corn tortilla's in half and then cutting them into half inch strips.
	Deep fry the tortilla strips in about an inch of oil in small batches until they turn a light golden brown. Sccoop them out from the oil and 
		place the tortilla strips on a paper napkin to drain the excess oil.</li>
	<li>Just before you dish the soupo out, squeeze in the juice of half a lime.</li>
	<li>Serve the soup topped with some black bean salsa (recipe here) and the crunchy tortilla strips. You can also garnish the soup with 
		sour cream, avocados ,cilantro, jalapenos, whatever you like!.</li>
