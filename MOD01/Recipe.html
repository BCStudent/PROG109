<strong>Ingredients</strong>
<ul>
	<li>2 pounds large carrots, trimmed and peeled</li>
	<li>6 Tbsp. white rice flour</li> 
	<li>6 Tbsp. canola oil</li>
	<li>2 tsp. garam masala (an Indian spice blend that can include cinnamon, pepper, cumin and cloves)</li>
	<li>2 tsp. kosher salt</li>
</ul>

<strong>Instructions</strong>
<ol>
	<li>Preheat oven to 450<sup>0</sup> and place the oven racks on the 2<sup>nd</sup> and 3<sup>rd</sup> positions. Cut carrots into French-fry-size sticks, 
		about 3" long. In a large bowl, toss carrots with rice flour to coat and shake off excess flour.</li>

	<li>Spread the carrots without crowding, in a single layer on two rimmed baking sheet lined with parchment paper. Bake 7 minutes. 
	Meanwhile, combine oil, garam masala, and salt in a large bowl. Gently remove carrots from the baking sheets and toss with oil mixture. 
	Return carrots to baking sheet and bake approx. 10-15 minutes or until crisp-tender and lightly browned along the edges.</li>
