  <h2>Web Development Overview</h2>
<p></p>
<ul>
	<li>Which topics covered during the last weeks provided you with new knowledge?</li>
	<p>As a newbie to web development, every topic we've covered has been new knowledge for me. When this class first began, 
		it was both challenging and easy to keep up with the course load. Once we began learning CSS and JavaSript, the
		class has become more challenging and difficult.</p>
	<br>
	<li>Which tools, methods, links, videos, etc., support your new skills? Please share!</li>
	<p>I've read the books, watched all the videos, used <a href="https://www.w3schools.com">w3 Schools</a> extensively, 
		<a href="https://www.google.com">Google</a> when I either can't find the answer or need it broken down more, and most
		importantly, fellow students! I've found the wisdom and helpful suggestions of my classmates to be invaluable!</p>
	<br>
	<li>What is your current grade in the class?</li>
	<p>Current grade is 96.8%.</p>
	<br>
	<li>Is there anything I can do to improve your online learning experience?</li>
	<p>You do a lot of things to help make it easier to learn the material! I take a lot off notes while watching the videos and 
		reading the books; however, I find I get lost when trying to review them later. It would be great if there were notes 
		or a list of "things you MUST know" after each lesson. Not sure how much effort would be involved to make this happen, 
		but it would help reinforce the lesson.</p>
	<br>
	<li>On average, how much time a week have you dedicated to this class?</li>
	<p>10+ hours</p>
  </li>
	</ul>
